If one VM is running a more resource heavy application,  allocate more resources to that one than the other VMs running on the same host machine.(represented as fat in diagram)
The VM that is running on the host machine (again, using a hypervisor) is also often called a “guest machine.” 
This guest machine contains both the application and whatever it needs to run that application (e.g. system binaries and libraries). 
It also carries an entire virtualized hardware stack of its own, including virtualized network adapters, storage, and CPU — which means it also has its own full-fledged guest operating system. 
From the inside, the guest machine behaves as its own unit with its own dedicated resources. 
From the outside, we know that it’s a VM — sharing resources provided by the host machine.

As mentioned above, a guest machine can run on either a hosted hypervisor or a bare-metal hypervisor. There are some important differences between them.

The hypervisors themselves run on physical computers, referred to as the “host machine”. 
The host machine provides the VMs with resources, including RAM and CPU. 
These resources are divided between VMs and can be distributed as you see fit.

Well, since the VM has a virtual operating system of its own, the hypervisor plays an essential role in providing the VMs with a platform to manage and execute this guest operating system. 
It allows for host computers to share their resources amongst the virtual machines that are running as guests on top of them.
