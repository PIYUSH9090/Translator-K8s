minikubeErrors


http://osxdaily.com/2018/12/31/install-run-virtualbox-macos-install-kernel-fails/

just a couple of mac restarts

enabling permissions fixed the issue.

Problems detected in "kube-addon-manager"

after this error deleted and started minikube

I second @rennekon's answer. I found that I had docker running on my machine which also installs kubectl. That installation of kubectl causes this issue to show.

I took the following steps:

uninstalled it using brew uninstall kubectl
reinstalled it using brew install kubectl
(due to symlink creation failure) I forced brew to create symlinks using brew link --overwrite kubernetes-cli
I was then able to run my kubectl apply commands successfully.

nginx brew start nginx or something like that is what worked.



docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e SA_LOGIC_API_URL='http://172.17.0.3:5000' maheshrajannan/sentiment-analysis-web-app3

oh god there is an option to deploy to kubernates by default.

I kept getting error when trying to do docker run -d -p that 8080 port is already allocated.

Resetting docker preferences to factory defaults did the trick. No it did NOT

For one issue resetting the docker preferences

Maheshs-MacBook-Pro-2:sa-webapp maheshrajannan$ ps -ef | grep java
  501  6161  3121   0  4:44PM ttys004    0:23.54 java -jar sentiment-analysis-web-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --sa.logic.api.url=http://localhost:5000
  501  6823  6180   0  5:59PM ttys008    0:00.00 grep java
Maheshs-MacBook-Pro-2:sa-webapp maheshrajannan$ kill -9 6161

In another case i had to stop nginx..i forgot nginx is running there.
sudo brew services stop nginx

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e SA_LOGIC_API_URL='http://172.17.0.2:5000' maheshrajannan/sentiment-analysis-web-app3

docker run -d -p 80:80 maheshrajannan/sentiment-analysis-frontend3

Second time i got port bind error because i was running sa-logic on 80.

Server/Client socket remember.

Client socket is localhost and Server Socket is the app inside the container.

kubernates that comes with Docker has some tweaks, looks like.

For the sake of learnign. let's not use that.

http://192.168.99.103:30086
is running.

When i do edit and resend on firefox tools it is going to that endpoint and returning message

oh god

i did docker ps and my local webapp container was runnign at localhost:8080

the browser was therefore going to localhost:80

i killed that container and everything is now going to the pod load balancer i want.

TODO:

how to login and see the logs from the pod ?
