1) Fix the high and critical, later.

Minikube kubernates vs Docker kubernates set up.

Continuous testing. Deploy to AWS/cloud provider instance and auto-test your app.

You can set a CI/CD pipeline with kubernates and it will autodeploy your app.

hmm...neat.

This app has 3 components.

Each component is docker image.Deploy the docker image i.e container, inside an cloud instance and auto-test it.

After each of 3 components test successfully, Put the 3 containers in one K8 pod(logical application host) and a service infront of it and test it.

Look at the sample file here and install it..
